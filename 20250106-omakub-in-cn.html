      <h2>Using Omakub in China</h2>

<p>Recently, I was contacted by someone who had been struggling to install
<a href="https://omakub.org/">Omakub</a> on his machine. Omakub is a tool to
setup a Linux desktop environment from scratch and it appears to instal <b>A LOT</b>
of different software from all over the world. For developers in China it is
common to struggle with access to certain endpoints (e.g. Google when downloading
Chrome). As people stumbled over the issue before and as it seems that a proxy
option request for Omakub is <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/issues/198">not accepted</a>
by DHH, here the details to make it work nevertheless.</p> 

<p>First of all Omakub is optimized for Ubuntu and like many other Linux
distributions the system-wide proxy is actually not system-wide. Android seems
to suffer under the same issue and I would love to find a person who tells me
that I'm stupid and in reality it is actually possible to set a system-wide
proxy. I was never able to figure it out in the past, so here come the <b>few</b> places
you have to configure to enforce all different toolings (and special users) to
use the same proxy:</p>

<p>
Everyone knows the default proxy variables. They come in lower
and upper case, because of cause they do:
<pre>export HTTP_PROXY=http://192.168.1.1:9090
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://192.168.1.1:9090
export http_proxy=http://192.168.1.1:9090
export https_proxy=http://192.168.1.1:9090
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<strike>Then we have apt and apt doesn't care about these standard variables
so you create a config file in the apt directory (e.g. <i>/etc/apt/apt.conf</i>) and
set:</strike>
<i>apt</i> respects the standard proxy variables but it would require to have
the environment variables set for root, as <i>apt</i> is called via sudo the
local variables are not set at the time when apt is being executed (thanks to
Felix for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282072426597744641?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7282072426597744641%2C7282766656630648834%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287282766656630648834%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7282072426597744641%29">the hint</a>). So we either
would need to change the Omakub scripts to call apt with <i>sudo -E</i> or we
add the proxy to <i>/etc/apt/apt.conf</i>:
<pre>Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.1.1:9090";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://192.168.1.1:9090";
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Omakub is also cloning repositories from Github. And as Github
is also from time to time blocked we need to set the proxy for <i>git</i> too:
<pre>git config --global http.proxy http://192.168.1.1:9090
git config --global https.proxy http://192.168.1.1:9090
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<i>wget</i> is used to download certificates (e.g. from Docker) and
usually this shouldn't be an issue as the default proxy variables are
used. Yet Omakub is <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/blob/90e0febcb9e1067aa336a5ca91e2665471fa068a/install/terminal/docker.sh#L3">calling wget with sudo</a> and let it write
directly to the keyring (instead of piping it via <i>tee</i>). So we
need root to also use the correct proxy settings. This can be done via a global
environment variable or by just creating <i>/root/.wgetrc</i> with the following
content:
<pre>use_proxy=on
http_proxy=http://192.168.1.1:9090
https_proxy=http://192.168.1.1:9090
</pre>
</p>

<p>
With this setup Omakub seems to install just fine.
</p>

<p>
After thinking a bit more about the setup and based on the feedback from Felix
I think adding the proxy variables to <i>/etc/environment</i> is the simpler
way forward. Considering that in this way you can skip the modification of
<i>/etc/apt/apt.conf</i> and <i>/root/.wgetrc</i>
