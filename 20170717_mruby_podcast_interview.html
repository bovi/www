      <h2>mruby podcast interview</h2>
<p>I have nearly forgot it but beginning of June I was interviewed by Software Engineering Daily about the implication of the bug bounty started by Shopify.</p>
<p><a href="/files/img_0324.jpg"><img width="324" height="116" alt="" src="/files/img_0324.jpg" title="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-79" srcset="/files/img_0324.jpg 324w, /files/img_0324-300x107.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/07/17/mruby-and-language-security-with-daniel-bovensiepen/">The podcast</a> is available as mp3 and there is also a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SED368-mruby.pdf">transcript</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the interview was the article I wrote <a href="https://blog.mruby.sh/201703261726.html">about Shopify</a>&nbsp;but in the end we covered quite a bit more than that. We started talking about the general use-cases of mruby and about the differences to MRI and JRuby.</p>
<p>I mentioned the <a href="https://github.com/hone/mruby-cli">mruby-cli</a>&nbsp;project from Heruko&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hone">Terence Lee</a>&nbsp;and the JRuby launcher based on mruby called <a href="https://github.com/jkutner/mjruby">mjruby</a>&nbsp;from <a href="https://github.com/jkutner">Joe Kutner</a>&nbsp;as some examples for command line applications. Also I talked about my prefered use-case of mruby, which is the integration into micro-controllers (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bovi/ias">Arduino Due</a>).</p>
<p>Afterwards we went into the details of <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/mruby-engine">Shopify&#8217;s usage of mruby</a>. We talked about the reason why Shopify is using mruby and why they opened a bug-bounty for it. I also mentioned in detail some of the most common bugs found by the security researchers.</p>
<p>A lot of the interview was then focused on how security researchers are finding bugs today. I mentioned the <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL Fuzzer</a>&nbsp;and my <a href="https://github.com/bovi/mruby-bin-mruby-afl">afl-optimized mruby version</a> to increase the fuzzing speed.</p>
<p>In the end we talked a bit about the differences of Ruby to other programming languages. The optimization of Ruby to solve a problem in very different ways and the complexity of the language itself, which makes the implementation quite complex but simplifies the usage at the same time.</p>
<p>In the original interview we also talked about C&#8217;s weaknesses and Rust as an alternative. But it seems this part was cut out of the interview for time reasons or they have an internal anti-rant policy at software engineering daily (-;</p>
