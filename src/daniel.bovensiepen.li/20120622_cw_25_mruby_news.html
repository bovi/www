      <h2>[CW 25] mruby news</h2>
<p>What happened this week on the mruby front?</p>
<h3>Struct</h3>
<p>Big work was done on the <code>Struct</code> library. This class doesn&#8217;t SEGV anymore, additional test cases were added and the possibility to add or remove this library from the mruby-core was integrated.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/ede3049f33f8c6cdb703784619fb4143bfe3b441">Commit (Struct Dis-/Enable)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/4f4965a4a20b1fba002d7b428508632604fd0b38">Commit (fix Struct Access)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/a843de0e90750557a30261b8008253a58baa429e">Commit (fix Struct initialize)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/f88a8399149f9b949f31f960d56d486a423efefa">Commit (Add Struct Tests)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/298">Commit (fix return value)</a></p>
<h3>Compile flags</h3>
<p>Till now the <code>CFLAGS</code> for mruby were always set to &#8220;-g -O3&#8243;. With this we had the benefit of having debug support build into every built. But most of the user out there might never use the gdb on mruby. So I decided to add the following three compile options to the Makefiles:</p>
<pre># compile with "-g -O3"
COMPILE_MODE=debug make

# compile with "-O3"
COMPILE_MODE=release make

# compile with "-Os"
COMPILE_MODE=small make</pre>

<h3>New Methods</h3>
<p><em>Symbol</em> got the spaceship method (<em>&lt;=&gt;</em>) and <em>Module</em> got also a lot (<em>define_method</em>, <em>attr</em>, <em>attr_reader</em>, <em>attr_writer</em>, <em>attr_accessor</em>). <em>Lambda</em> got <em>initialize_copy</em> and is now duplicable.</p>

<h3>printf</h3>
<p>One method I was wondering about is <em>printf</em>. This one was also added this week. printf is working like <em>print</em> but calls <em>sprintf</em> before its execution. Due to the reason that <em>sprintf</em> is an optional feature of mruby-core, <em>printf</em> should be optional too. But it appears that <em>printf</em> is implemented in pure Ruby and has no compiler switch by now. Lets see what happens with this method.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I made a change to <code>printf</code>. Now it is only available if <code>sprintf</code> is also enabled. I used <code>respond_to?</code> to check if <code>sprintf</code> is available. I&#8217;m curious if this is the best way. This code will now also be compiled into the core, even if <code>sprintf</code> was deactivated. It won&#8217;t be executed but at least during initialization it will be called one-time. I guess it is ok for now but in case this kind of stuff is growing there might be another solution necessary.</p>

<h3>Optional Tests</h3>
<p>Lately I played around with the customization of mruby. While I removed some features I notice that the test cases are failing (good indicator that they are working). Nevertheless I don&#8217;t want to see failing tests if I decided to not use specific features of mruby. So I decided to patch this behavior away. My first approach was to define a new constant which defines the configuration of the mruby-core. Matz actually suggested to check if the related class is defined. In the end this solution is more implementation-independent. All tests which are testing optional mruby features are from now on not executed if the feature is disabled.</p>

<h3>strlen replacement by sizeof</h3>
<p>Masaki Muranaka <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/301">suggested</a> to reduce the use of <code>strlen</code> due to the reason that on small systems it is to blown. I think it is a good idea to look at optimization of the code but I&#8217;m not completely sure if now is already the right time to optimize parts of mruby. <code>sizeof</code> instead of <code>strlen</code> might not be such a dramatic optimization. But I&#8217;m afraid that we try to early to optimize the core and make the code in this way harder to read.</p>
