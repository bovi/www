      <h2>[CW 24] mruby news</h2>
<p>What happened this week on the mruby front?</p>
<h3>No Eval</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/261">a request of Masaki Muranaka</a> the non-functional code of eval was removed from mruby. Herewith it should be clear that this kind of feature won&#8217;t be inside of the mruby-core.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/324de1a">Commit</a></p>
<h3>New Exception</h3>
<p>To indicate that some features won&#8217;t be ever implemented inside of the mruby-core the new Exception <code>NotImplementedError</code> was implemented as a sub-class of <code>ScriptError</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/a74ab0c">Commit</a></p>
<h3>Improve customization</h3>
<p>An important mruby feature from my point of view is the focus of customization. For this, mruby provides <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/master/include/mrbconf.h">include/mrbconf.h</a> which provides the possibility to customize the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Float instead of Double</li>
<li>Disable/Enable Regexp</li>
<li>Disable/Enable sprintf</li>
<li>Disable/Enable Math</li>
<li>Disable/Enable Time</li>
</ul>
<div>I would wish to also have the possibility in the future to even cut out other classes out of the mruby-core for very specific tasks easily. By now I&#8217;m doing this by just deleting the fitting code file inside of src or mrblib, but of course this could have some side-effects which you have to check.</div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/764a791f">Commit Math</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/8c838de">Commit Time</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/263">Commit sprintf</a></p>
<h3>Test improvement</h3>
<p>Another commit of Masaki Muranaka improves the test framework which I had previously added to mruby. On his <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/monamour555">Twitter account</a> he is complaining that the test coverage is less than sufficient at the moment. I completely agree with this statement. The basic problem is of course that mruby wasn&#8217;t test-driven developed but is partly based on the CRuby source code. I think the only way to improve this situation is by adding one test at a time for a very long time. Slowly we will get a sufficient coverage in that way. Already now some people reporting bugs based on the mrbtest tool.</p>
<p>Another construction area would be an additional test environment in mruby which is covering the C API of mruby. I hope that there will be a fruitful <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/293">discussion</a> about this.</p>
