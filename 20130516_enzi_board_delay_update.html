      <h2>Enzi Board delay [update]</h2>
<p>A while ago I pre-ordered some of these red and cute <a href="http://enzi.cc/">Enzi boards</a>. The board is specially interesting to me due to its Cortex M4 and the 196kb SRAM. The 96kb SRAM of the Arduino Due is a bit to little.</p>
<p>Sadly I got just now a mail that the planned released (April 2013) wasn&#8217;t possible for several unknown reasons. So there will still be quite some time to the release I guess :-( I would have wished to learn what the release problems are. Is it a design issue of the board or are they stucked in the manufactoring process? We also have every now and then issues with board productions, so I could understand such a issues.</p>
<h3>Update [2013-05-17]</h3>
<p>I was just informed that there are still important documents to be finish for legal and quality assurance reasons. Also some bugs still have to be fixed.</p>
<p>So all in all it seems promising. Lets look forward to the release.</p>
